## Code of Conduct

This project follows a code of conduct to ensure a welcoming environment for all contributors. By participating, you agree to:

- Be respectful and inclusive
- Focus on constructive feedback
- Accept responsibility for mistakes
- Show empathy towards other contributors
- Help create a positive community

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally
3. **Set up your development environment** (see below)
4. **Create a feature branch** for your changes
5. **Make your changes** following our guidelines
6. **Write tests** for your changes
7. **Submit a pull request**

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Ruby 2.6.0 or higher
- Bundler

### Setup Steps

1. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/replicate-ruby.git
   cd replicate-ruby
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

3. Run the tests to ensure everything works:
   ```bash
   bundle exec rake test
   ```

4. Start a console session for experimentation:
   ```bash
   bin/console
   ```

## How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions

- **Bug fixes**: Fix issues in the codebase
- **Features**: Add new functionality
- **Documentation**: Improve documentation, examples, or guides
- **Tests**: Add or improve test coverage
- **Code quality**: Refactor code, improve performance, or enhance maintainability

### Finding Issues

- Check the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/dreamingtulpa/replicate-ruby/issues) for open issues
- Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`
- Comment on an issue to indicate you're working on it

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

We use [RuboCop](https://rubocop.org/) for code style enforcement. The rules are defined in `.rubocop.yml`.

- Run RuboCop before submitting:
  ```bash
  bundle exec rubocop
  ```

- Auto-fix issues where possible:
  ```bash
  bundle exec rubocop -a
  ```

### Naming Conventions

- **Modules/Classes**: PascalCase (e.g., `Replicate::Client`)
- **Methods**: snake_case (e.g., `retrieve_model`)
- **Constants**: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `VERSION`)
- **Files**: snake_case matching class/module names

### Documentation

- Use YARD format for all public methods
- Include parameter types, return values, and examples
- Document exceptions that may be raised

Example:
```ruby
# Creates a prediction using this model version
#
# @param input [Hash] The input parameters for the model
# @param webhook [String, nil] Optional webhook URL
# @return [Replicate::Record::Prediction] The created prediction
# @raise [Replicate::Error] If prediction creation fails
def predict(input, webhook = nil)
  # implementation
end
```

### Commit Messages

Follow conventional commit format:

- `feat:` - New features
- `fix:` - Bug fixes
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring
- `test:` - Test additions/changes
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

Examples:
- `feat: add support for model collections`
- `fix: handle timeout errors in predictions`
- `docs: update README with webhook examples`

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
bundle exec rake test

# Run specific test file
bundle exec ruby test/replicate/client_test.rb
```

### Writing Tests

- Use Minitest framework
- Test files should be in `test/` directory
- Mirror the lib structure (e.g., `test/replicate/client_test.rb`)
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and failure cases
- Use WebMock for HTTP request mocking

Example test structure:
```ruby
class ClientTest < Minitest::Test
  def test_retrieve_model_success
    # Test successful model retrieval
  end

  def test_retrieve_model_not_found
    # Test error handling for non-existent models
  end
end
```

### Test Coverage

Maintain high test coverage (>90%). Run coverage reports with:

```bash
# If using simplecov
bundle exec rake test
# Check coverage/index.html
```

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process

1. **Create a feature branch** from `master`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following the guidelines above

3. **Run the full test suite**:
   ```bash
   bundle exec rake test
   bundle exec rubocop
   ```

4. **Update documentation** if needed

5. **Commit your changes** with clear messages

6. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

7. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub:
   - Use a clear title describing the change
   - Provide a detailed description of what was changed and why
   - Reference any related issues
   - Ensure CI checks pass

### Pull Request Requirements

- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Code style checks pass
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated (if applicable)
- [ ] Commit messages follow conventional format

### Review Process

- A maintainer will review your PR
- They may request changes or ask questions
- Once approved, your PR will be merged
- You may be asked to squash commits for cleaner history
